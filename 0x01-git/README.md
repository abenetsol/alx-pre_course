My first readme
Create a new directory called 0x01-git
Inside 0x01-git:

Create these directories at the root of your project: bash, c, js
Create these empty files:
c/c_is_fun.c
js/main.js
js/index.js
Create a file bash/alx with these two lines inside: #!/bin/bash and echo "ALX"
Create a file bash/school with these two lines inside: #!/bin/bash and echo "School"
Update the file bash/alx by replacing echo "ALX" with echo "ALX School is so cool!"
Delete the directory js
